# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com and log in
2. Click the "+" button in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (suggested: `gedcom-processing` or `family-tree-tools`)
5. Add a description: "Comprehensive GEDCOM file processing and genealogical data cleaning tools"
6. Set to **Private** (recommended for family data)
7. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin merge-gedfix-architecture

# If you want to also push to main branch (optional)
git checkout -b main
git merge merge-gedfix-architecture
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and commit history
3. Check that the file sizes are reasonable (GEDCOM files can be large)
