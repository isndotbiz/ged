# RootsMagic 10 Cleanup Sources for Merge

## Primary Candidate (Best RM10 Work)
**File**: /Users/jonathanmallinger/Documents/Family Tree Maker/JDMallinger.ged
- **Date**: July 14, 2025 14:32:41  
- **Size**: 684,414 bytes
- **People**: 1,206 individuals (reduced from ~1460 - significant manual cleanup!)
- **Date Integrity**: âœ… EXCELLENT - Has intact birth/death dates (1817, 8 APR 1776, etc.)
- **Status**: This file represents your most recent RootsMagic 10 cleanup work
- **Archive Location**: data/archive/JDMallinger.ged

## Secondary Candidates (Alternative RM10 Work)
**JDMallinger.ged.ged**: 1,187 people (archived)
- Even more aggressive cleanup (219 fewer people than primary)
- May have removed too much data

## Comparison with Master
- **Master file**: 1,469 people (data/master/master.ged)
- **RM10 primary**: 1,206 people (263 people removed)
- **Net reduction**: Your manual work removed 263 individuals (18% reduction)
- **Goal**: Merge the RM10 improvements while preserving master's date integrity

## Merge Strategy
1. Use master.ged as baseline (pristine dates)
2. Import non-date improvements from JDMallinger.ged
3. Focus on preserving the 263-person reduction (your cleanup work)
4. Keep all birth/death dates from master file
5. Merge structural improvements, corrected names, etc.

## Files to Avoid (Corrupted Dates)
- 0819.ged, clean.ged, yes1.ged series (all have date corruption indicators)
