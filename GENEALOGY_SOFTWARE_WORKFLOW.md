## 🚀 OPTION 5: Create Portable Package (Advanced)

If you want to share your complete tree with family members, create a portable package:

### Step 1: Create Media-Included GEDCOM
```bash
# Copy media to a relative path structure
mkdir -p /Users/jonathanmallinger/Desktop/mallinger_family_tree/media
cp -r /Users/jonathanmallinger/Documents/mallinger_media/* /Users/jonathanmallinger/Desktop/mallinger_family_tree/media/

# Copy GEDCOM file
cp data/processing/exports/FINAL_CLEANED_WITH_MEDIA_master_geo_media_20250828.ged /Users/jonathanmallinger/Desktop/mallinger_family_tree/mallinger_family_tree.ged
```

### Step 2: Update GEDCOM Paths (if needed)
The media paths in the GEDCOM are already relative, so they should work with this structure.

### Step 3: Package for Sharing
```bash
cd /Users/jonathanmallinger/Desktop
zip -r mallinger_family_tree_complete.zip mallinger_family_tree/
```

**✅ Result:** Complete package family members can download and import anywhere

## 📋 Media Linking Guide

Use the `media_suggestions.txt` file to efficiently link photos. Here's how to read it:

```
Media File: Thomas Herring.jpg
----------------------------------------
  → @I310@ - Thomas /Herring/ (score: 26)
  → @I21@ - Thomas /Worts/ (score: 13)
  → @I25@ - Thomas /Worts/ (score: 13)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Thomas Herring.jpg** most likely belongs to **Thomas Herring** (highest score: 26)
- The @I310@ is the individual ID in the GEDCOM
- Lower scores are less likely matches

### Priority for Linking:
1. **Score 20+:** Very likely match - link with confidence
2. **Score 10-19:** Possible match - review carefully  
3. **Score 5-9:** Weak match - investigate further
4. **No suggestions:** Review filename and content manually

## ✅ Quality Assurance Checklist

After importing into any software:

### Verify Data Integrity

### Address Manual Review Items
- [ ] **Review high-priority issues:** Use `manual_review_required.md`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Media Files Not Found"
**Solution:** Make sure your media folder path is correct and files haven't moved

### "Some Photos Don't Match People"
**Solution:** Use the suggestions file as a guide, but trust your knowledge of family photos

### "GEDCOM Import Errors"
**Solution:** The cleaned GEDCOM is GEDCOM 5.5.1 compliant - check software version compatibility

### "Too Many AutoFix Notes"
**Solution:** These preserve original unrecognized dates - you can clean them up manually in your software
