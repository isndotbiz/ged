## üîç POTENTIAL DUPLICATES DETECTED (365 candidates)

**CRITICAL:** 365 potential duplicate individuals found by gedfix analysis  
**Status:** NOT automatically merged (to preserve data integrity)  
**Recommended Action:**  
1. Use RootsMagic or Family Tree Maker duplicate detection tools  
2. Review high-confidence matches (100% similarity scores) first  
3. Manually merge duplicates with full context visibility

**High Confidence Examples:**
- @I13@ and @I29@ (100.0% match)  
- @I17@ and @I34@ (100.0% match)  
- @I19@ and @I840@ (100.0% match)  
- And many more...

## üìã RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Complete First)
1. **Import your cleaned GEDCOM** (`master_geo_media_standardized.ged`) into RootsMagic or preferred genealogy software
2. **Address the 34 high-priority genealogical logic issues** listed above
3. **Run duplicate detection** in your genealogy software and merge obvious duplicates

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements (As Time Permits)  
1. Review medium-priority issues when doing research on specific individuals  
2. Standardize remaining place/name spellings using your software's tools
3. Connect orphaned individuals to families where appropriate

### Phase 3: Maintenance
1. **Re-export clean GEDCOM** after manual fixes  
2. **Import to other platforms** (Ancestry, MyHeritage, FamilySearch)  
3. **Maintain one platform as master** to avoid sync conflicts
