**Source**: MyHeritage Tree Consistency Checker Analysis

## üìã Overview

These issues require careful genealogical review and human judgment. They cannot be automatically fixed as they may represent legitimate historical variations or require additional research to resolve correctly.

## üö® HIGH PRIORITY - Date Logic Errors (46 issues)

These represent impossible genealogical sequences that need immediate attention:

### Child Born After Parent Death (11 instances)
**Issue**: Children recorded as born after their parent died  
**Example Pattern**: "Walter Spong was born on 1754, after the death of his father William Spong on 1721"

**Actions Required**:
1. ‚úÖ **Verify parent death date** - Check sources for accuracy
2. ‚úÖ **Verify child birth date** - Confirm birth year is correct  
3. ‚úÖ **Check for adoption/step-relationships** - Child might be step-child or adopted
4. ‚úÖ **Research family circumstances** - Wars, migrations, etc. that might explain discrepancies

### Facts Occurring After Death (20 instances)
**Issue**: Events (like marriages) recorded after person's death date  
**Example Pattern**: "Date of Marriage of Eleanor 'Elienor' Ford (May 1 1703) occurred after her death date (1702)"

**Actions Required**:
1. ‚úÖ **Verify death date accuracy** - Check death records and sources
2. ‚úÖ **Verify event date accuracy** - Confirm marriage/event actually occurred
3. ‚úÖ **Consider posthumous events** - Some events can legitimately occur after death
4. ‚úÖ **Check for remarriage confusion** - Event might belong to different person

### Facts Occurring Before Birth (15 instances)  
**Issue**: Events recorded before person's birth date
**Example Pattern**: Marriage occurring before birth date

**Actions Required**:
1. ‚úÖ **Verify birth date** - Check birth records for accuracy
2. ‚úÖ **Verify event date** - Confirm event date is correct
3. ‚úÖ **Check calendar systems** - Julian vs Gregorian calendar differences
4. ‚úÖ **Review data entry** - Common transcription errors

## ‚öñÔ∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY - Age-Related Issues (96 issues)

These require genealogical judgment based on historical context:

### Parents Too Young (51 instances)
**Issue**: Parents having children at very young ages (typically under 15)
**Historical Context**: Marriage and childbearing ages varied significantly by era and culture

**Review Guidelines**:
- **Medieval/Early periods**: Earlier marriages were more common
- **Check for adoption**: Child might be adopted/step-child
- **Verify dates**: Common area for transcription errors
- **Research local customs**: Some cultures had different norms

### Extreme Age at Death (13 instances)
**Issue**: People living over 100+ years  
**Example**: "Duncan Gilchrist (born December 28 1745, died 1855) was rather old at death (at least 109 years old)"

**Review Guidelines**:
- **Check birth/death sources** - Very common area for century errors (1745 vs 1845)
- **Research longevity records** - Some centenarians are historically documented
- **Verify family records** - Cross-check with other family member dates
- **Consider estimation dates** - "About" or "circa" dates may be estimates

### Parents Too Old (13 instances)
**Issue**: Parents having children at advanced ages (55+ for mothers, 65+ for fathers)

**Review Guidelines**:
- **Later-life children** can be legitimate, especially for fathers
- **Check for second marriages** - New spouse might be much younger
- **Verify maternal ages** carefully - Less likely but possible
- **Consider adoption** or step-relationships

### Married Too Young (19 instances)  
**Issue**: People married at very young ages

**Review Guidelines**:
- **Historical context** - Marriage ages varied by era (medieval vs modern)
- **Check local laws/customs** - Different regions had different norms
- **Verify dates** - Common transcription error area
- **Consider betrothal vs marriage** - Some records mix engagement and marriage

---

## üîÑ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Duplicate Relationships (34 issues)

### Multiple Marriages of Same Couple (34 instances)
**Issue**: Same couple has multiple marriage records

**Actions Required**:
1. ‚úÖ **Compare marriage details** - Date, place, sources
2. ‚úÖ **Identify most complete record** - Keep the one with most information
3. ‚úÖ **Check for different ceremonies** - Religious vs civil ceremonies
4. ‚úÖ **Remove true duplicates** - Keep only unique marriages

---

## üë• LOW PRIORITY - Family Structure Issues (12 issues)

### Orphaned Individuals (6 instances)
**Issue**: People with no family connections in your tree

**Actions Required**:
1. ‚úÖ **Research family connections** - Look for parents, spouses, children
2. ‚úÖ **Check if they belong** - Might be unrelated people added by mistake
3. ‚úÖ **Connect if appropriate** - Link to correct family members
4. ‚úÖ **Document research** - Note what you've tried to find

### Sibling Issues (6 instances)
- **Close age siblings** - May indicate twins
- **Same first names** - Need clarification or Jr./Sr. distinctions

## üìù Recommended Review Process

### Phase 1: Date Logic Errors (Highest Impact)
1. Start with "Child After Parent Death" - Usually clear-cut errors
2. Address "Facts After Death" - Often transcription errors  
3. Review "Facts Before Birth" - Check calendar conversions

### Phase 2: Age Issues (Research Intensive)
1. Focus on extreme ages first (100+ years) - Often century errors
2. Review young parent ages - Check for adoption patterns
3. Examine marriage ages in historical context

### Phase 3: Duplicates & Structure (Cleanup)
1. Remove duplicate marriages - Keep most complete records
2. Connect orphaned individuals where appropriate
3. Clarify sibling distinctions
