### 🚀 Overall Cleanup Achievement:

| Stage | Input | Output | Change | Sources |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Original** | 63,172 lines<br/>1,469 people | - | - | 294 |

## 🔧 Technical Success Factors

### ✅ What Made This Work:
1. **Created New Source-Safe Script**: Built `source_preserving_person_dedupe.py` from scratch
2. **Separate Source Handling**: Parsed and stored all 294 source records independently  
3. **Reference Integrity**: Updated family relationships properly during merges
4. **Data Preservation**: Merged all information from duplicate records instead of deleting
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Generated detailed reports of all changes

### ⚠️ Key Lesson Learned:
The original `fixed_deduplicate.py` script was **losing sources** during the merge process. This is a critical issue in genealogy work where sources are essential for data credibility. The new script explicitly preserves all source records.
