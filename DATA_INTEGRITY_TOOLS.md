# 🛡️ GEDCOM Data Integrity Tools - Complete

## ✅ Successfully Created & Tested

### 1. **Data Integrity Verification Script** (`scripts/verify_data_integrity.sh`)
- **Purpose**: Ensures no genealogical data is lost during processing
- **Features**:
  - Counts all critical GEDCOM record types (individuals, families, sources, etc.)
  - Compares before/after processing states
  - Detects data loss with red alerts
  - Shows detailed statistics with `--detailed` flag
  - Provides sample record inspection
- **Tested**: ✅ Successfully detected missing sources in processed file

```bash
# Basic comparison
scripts/verify_data_integrity.sh original.ged processed.ged

# Detailed analysis with sample records
scripts/verify_data_integrity.sh original.ged processed.ged --detailed
```

### 2. **Processing Workspace Setup** (`scripts/setup_processing_workspace.sh`)
- **Purpose**: Creates safe working environment with timestamped backups
- **Features**:
  - Creates organized directory structure
  - Makes timestamped backups (verified by size)
  - Sets up symbolic links for easy access
  - Creates processing logs
  - Generates workspace documentation
- **Tested**: ✅ Successfully created workspace and backup for `roots_master.ged`

```bash
# Setup workspace and backup your GEDCOM file
scripts/setup_processing_workspace.sh data/master/roots_master.ged

# Setup workspace only (no backup)
scripts/setup_processing_workspace.sh
```

### 3. **Rollback Recovery System** (`scripts/rollback_to_backup.sh`)
- **Purpose**: Automatically restores from backups when processing goes wrong
- **Features**:
  - Lists all available backups with metadata
  - Interactive backup selection
  - Validates backup integrity before restore
  - Creates safety backup of current state
  - Logs all rollback operations
- **Tested**: ✅ Successfully lists backups and shows detailed info

```bash
# List available backups
scripts/rollback_to_backup.sh --list

# Interactive rollback (recommended)
scripts/rollback_to_backup.sh

# Rollback to specific timestamp
scripts/rollback_to_backup.sh --backup-timestamp 20250824_234759 --restore-to data/master/restored.ged
```

## 🔬 Test Results Summary

### Your `roots_master.ged` File Statistics:
- **1,469 individuals** ✅
- **645 families** ✅  
- **294 source records** ✅
- **4,754 date records** ✅
- **3,214 place records** ✅
- **1,620 source citations** ✅
- **All family relationships intact** ✅

### Data Loss Detection Test:
```bash
$ scripts/verify_data_integrity.sh roots_master.ged clean_working_master_processed.ged

❌ DATA LOSS: Sources (SOUR): 294 → 0 (LOST: 294)
❌ DATA INTEGRITY COMPROMISED: 1 issues found
❌ DO NOT USE the processed file - data loss detected
```

**Perfect!** The system correctly detected that the processed file lost all source records.
